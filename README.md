## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to kickstart your Nebula journey:

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and install dependencies using Composer:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/libra-php/nebula.git
   cd nebula
   composer install
   ```

2. **Configuration**: Customize your project by editing configuration files, including database settings. Copy the example environment configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Dependencies**: Nebula requires essential dependencies such as Redis (caching, rate limiting) and MySQL (database). See documentation.

4. **Development**: Begin building your application by creating controllers, views, and models within the `app` directory. Feel free to modify the framework source code located in the  `src` directory. Start a local development server with:
   ```bash
   ./nebula -s
   # Application will be served here: http://127.0.0.1:8888/
   ```


## ‚≠ê Docker Integration

Simplify your deployment process with Docker. Launch the entire stack in one command

1. Launch the Nebula stack:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   # Application will be served here: http://localhost/
   ```

2. Shut down the stack:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

3. Access the application container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec nebula-app bash
   # Try launching the cli tool
   ./nebula -h
   ```

   `/shared/httpd`: project base directory

4. Access the database container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec nebula-mysql bash
   # Start MySQL with your .env db password credentials
   mysql -u root -p
   ```

5. Access the logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f 
   ```
